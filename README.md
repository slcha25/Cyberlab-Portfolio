## 👋 Welcome

This is my student artifact repository for Phase 1 of the TKH Innovation Fellowship Cybersecurity program. Every week I push the work I build in class — scripts, lab outputs, notes, and documentation — so there is a living record of how far I have come.

I came into this program as a former Math, Economics, and Accounting teacher with a full-stack development background. Cybersecurity was new territory. This repository is proof that it is possible to start from zero and build something real, week by week.

## 💡 Core Concepts

**The CIA Triad**

| Property | Question It Answers | Example |
|----------|--------------------|----|
| Confidentiality | Who can see it? | `chmod 600 secrets.txt` |
| Integrity | Has it been tampered with? | Git commit hashes |
| Availability | Can authorized users access it? | Uptime, backups, failover |

**The Holy Trinity of Text Processing**
```
grep  →  finds lines that match a pattern       (The Scalpel)
sed   →  finds and replaces text on the fly     (The Laser)
awk   →  extracts specific columns from data    (The Formatter)
```

**Git as an Accountability Tool**

Every `git commit` creates a cryptographic hash — a tamper-evident, timestamped, attributed record of exactly what changed and when. That is Accounting — the third pillar of the AAA framework.

**Defense in Depth**

No single security control is sufficient. The work across Weeks 04, 07, and 11 demonstrates how layering firewall rules, IDS signatures, and endpoint monitoring creates overlapping protection where a breach of one layer does not mean a breach of all.

**Python as a Security Force Multiplier**

The scripts in Week 03 (`brute_detector.py`, `incident_response.py`) demonstrate the foundational logic of SOAR platforms — ingest a log source, apply a detection rule, extract indicators of compromise, and export a structured alert. Automation turns a human-hours task into a seconds task.

**The Attacker's Journey (Unified Kill Chain)**

This portfolio follows the full 18-phase Unified Kill Chain — from reconnaissance and exploitation (Weeks 07–09) to persistence, lateral movement (Week 08), collection, and impact — and then documents the defender's counter at every layer (Weeks 10–11).
